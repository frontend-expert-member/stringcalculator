Explanation
Component:

The StringCalculator component consists of an input field and a button to calculate the sum.
The calculateSum function handles the parsing and summing of the numbers.
Test Cases:

The test cases cover various scenarios, such as an empty string, comma-separated numbers, newlines as delimiters, custom delimiters, and ignoring invalid numbers.
To run these tests, you need a React environment set up with Jest and @testing-library/react. You can run the tests using the command npm test if you have the necessary configuration in place.
